Magical Unicorn Light:

Is your computer not rainbow powered, and can't handle the detailed version of the Magical Unicorn font? Here is a solution!

The Magical Unicorn font is a display typeface for large sizes and consists of two different typefaces, the Princess (a normal Unicorn) and the Sans (without horn) Each letter has two different versions usable by typing in lower case or capitals. Punctuation, numerals and many other glyphs are included. Since the font is for headers mostly, I didn't include glyphs such as the Dollar Sign, percent or various brackets.

Please do give the Unicorns a good place to graze in your creations.

If you use the font, please do give me link showcasing your use, since I am interested in the ways it will be used. It also will help me improve the font or inspire me for a next release.
